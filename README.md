### 🌐 Campus Recruitment System (Website)  
> Built to make campus hiring less stressful for everyone. This web app connects students and recruiters on a single platform — students can create profiles, upload resumes, and apply for jobs, while recruiters can post openings and manage interviews. The goal was simple: cut down the paperwork, bring transparency, and give both sides a smoother experience.
